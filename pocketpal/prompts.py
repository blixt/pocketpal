# TODO: Refactor these prompts into this format:
# 1. System prompt with solid instructions
# 2. Tool calls for gathering structured data from the LLM (even if it's just one string).
#    (Use forced tool calls for this.)
# 3. The user message which should only contain actual user input to avoid confusion between user input and LLM instructions.

# Probably we merge llm.py and prompts.py and use llm.bind_tools(â€¦) and SystemMessage etc.
# - generate_new_story_info(premise)
# - generate_new_branch(language, story, sentiment, final=False)

# Thoughts on prompts below:
# - We should iterate on what "positive" and "negative" mean for the LLM.
#   -> We should not tell the LLM just "positive" or "negative"
#   -> "positive" => "Progress the story, adding a new situation"
#   -> "negative" => "Continue the story, but not in the way the most recent paragraphs were going"
# - If we want to expand the scope, there's no need to tell the LLM anything about "fantasy novels" or "audio-game"
# - Let's try to be more specific about the length of the content the LLM gives us for better consistency
# - The rest seems great (second person, present tense, etc)
# - Consider adding a target audience setting for a story ("for 4-year-olds", "for adults", or just "automatic" to let the LLM choose)


def get_initial_prompt(story_description):
    return f"""Please take this input JSON:

{json.dumps({"story_premise": story_description}, indent=4)}

And turn it into a new story with only its first paragraph written, and not too long.
The paragraph should finish with a situation where there is an alternative choice that will change the original flow of the story. The alternatives should be one that propels the story forward, and one that changes the direction of the story.
You write using the language that was used for the premise and in the second person in the present tense to make the experience more immersive.
The title for the story should be unique and intriguing, fit for the cover of a book, based on the premise and beginning of the story.

Provide a JSON object matching this TypeScript interface:

interface Story {{
    lang: "es" | "en" | "pt" | "se";
    paragraph: string;
    description: string;
    title: string;
}}

DO NOT PUT BACKTICKS. Only write raw JSON.

def get_continue_prompt(story, language, sentiment):
    luck = random.randint(1, 3)
    return f"""# Task
You are a talented fantasy novels writer that is working on an audio-game.
You write using the provided language and the second person in the present tense to make the experience more immersive.
The story is very impredictable and interesting, going wilder on every paragraph.
The user will steer the story by providing "positive" input, or "negative" input.
The positive input is more ethical and conservative. It tries to preserve what the main character has achieved so far by minimizing the risk. Low risk, low reward.
The negative input is more greedy and evil. It tries to improve the characters situation, at a higher risk of making it worse. High risk, high reward.
Write a paragraph based on the input, the user signal, and the luck number[1,2,3].
The paragraph should finish with a situation where there is a low risk, low reward choice or a high risk, high reward choice.
